# **App Name**: TaskMaster Pro

## Core Features:

- Secure Login: Implement a secure login system with different access levels based on user roles.
- Create Task: Allow users to create new tasks with descriptions, due dates, and assigned personnel.
- Assign Task: Assign tasks to specific users based on their roles and availability.
- Manage Task: Allow managers to view the task assignee's names. Let team members drag and drop tasks through a status pipeline: To Do, In Progress, and Completed.
- AI Task Prioritization: Use AI to suggest task priorities based on deadlines, importance, and user roles.
- AI Task Tools: The app can offer users suggestions for actions on tasks or the optimal assignees based on roles. LLM analyzes user input and available data to make contextually relevant suggestions. LLM uses reasoning to decide when or if to incorporate some piece of information in its output; it is therefore a tool.
- Dashboard: Dashboard displaying tasks completed, tasks per person, employee performance, tasks completed per month, report generation tab, new task option, update/manage tasks option, account management, and logout.
- Role-Based Access Control: Role-based access control allowing admins and managers full access, supervisors to view/reassign tasks to junior supervisors. Tasks cannot be assigned to higher hierarchy.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498DB) to convey trust, security, and efficiency.
- Background color: Very light cyan (#EBF5FB), offering a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that contrasts gently with other elements.
- Accent color: Royal blue (#4879DF), a color that borrows its brightness and saturation from the primary, creating visual interest and focus.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use minimalist icons representing task categories and actions.
- Implement a Kanban-style board layout for task management.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for task updates and assignments.
